					<div class="textmargin1">	
					In 2126, a Full-Dive Massively multiplayer online role-playing game or DMMORPG called YGGDRASIL was released, standing out among all other DMMORPGs due to its unusually high ability for the player to interact with the game. 
						After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. 
						Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. 
						Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal Lich "Overlord" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick.
						 In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. 
						While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.</div>
