								<li> <b> Sebas Tian</b> (セバス・チャン) is the head butler of the Great Tomb of Nazarick with several manservants and other butlers under his command.
								 He was created by Touch Me. He is also the leader of the Pleiades Six Stars.
                                 Although he is not one of the Floor Guardians, his power closely rivals theirs. 
								 In a way, he is independent of their chain of command. He originally served as Nazarick's last line of defense alongside the Pleiades on the 9th Floor, 
								 to give time for the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, to prepare for their final stand in the Throne Room.
								 n his human form, Sebas Tian has the appearance of an elderly butler and he is dressed gracefully in his traditional black uniform. Sebas' hair is entirely white, just like his immaculate beard. 
								 He has visible wrinkles on his hollow face, which makes him seem gentle in appearance, but his eyes are as sharp as an eagle's.
								  However, in the manga, his beard is longer, his shoulders are not as broad </ul>
